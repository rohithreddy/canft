Canft is an NFT market built on the PoS-based blockchain, [Casper Network](https://casper-network.com/). But it is not only a market for NFTs if not a decentralized market.

On the platform, you can create your NFTs on the Casper blockchain network, sell your NFTs, buy them or place them at auction. Apart from this, you can also propose themes to promote with special collectibles, for example, Halloween, Christmas, kittens, zombies, Casper, Gaming, etc ... every certain season.

You cannot allow a greater breadth for the creations of the artists and a greater interaction for these types of communities, the idea is not only to sell the NFTs but also that the artists can actually exhibit their works and interact with other artists.

Canft is an NFT market built on the PoS-based blockchain, [Casper Network](https://casper-network.com/). But it is not only a market for NFTs if not a decentralized market.

On the platform, you can create your NFTs on the Casper blockchain network, sell your NFTs, buy them or place them at auction. Apart from this, you can also propose themes to promote with special collectibles, for example, Halloween, Christmas, kittens, zombies, Casper, Gaming, etc ... every certain season.

You cannot allow a greater breadth for the creations of the artists and a greater interaction for these types of communities, the idea is not only to sell the NFTs but also that the artists can actually exhibit their works and interact with other artists.

## Why Casper Network?

The Casper Network is the first live proof-of-stake blockchain built off the Casper CBC specification. Casper is designed to accelerate enterprise and developer adoption of blockchain technology today and evolve to meet user needs in the future.

> Casper also solves the scalability trilemma. Notably, the network is optimized for security, decentralization, and high throughput. 
All this is achieved while evolving to provide leading solutions for open-source projects and enterprises.

This certainly means that thanks to Casper, canft users will pay a lower fee for their interactions and get the benefit of a fast network. (Who wants to spend several minutes on purchase these days?). 

But it's not just about low fees and high speed, it's about security as well. In the end, the nfts will be assets and as all assets must be protected, that is why Casper is ideal, since thanks to its architecture that breaks [the blockchain trilemma](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain-trilemma), we can say with certainty that Casper is safe.
